   GAEN is freeware. You may modify the code to suit your needs, but you
   must NOT alter the credits.
                                      
   GAEN Distribution is freely available in the following distribution:
   the GAEN M (18) version (August 1996 - December 2001). This version is
   available in .tar.gz format (unpack with gunzip and tar -xf commands
   at the UNIX shell prompt):

     * gaen_M_18.tar.gz talker files (sources, config, data, help,
       additional files) - about 330Kb
       
                Enhancements and facilities in this version

     * .who and .people commands accept the new 'brief' parameter to show
       only the users information ('brief' can be substituted by '-')
     * increased compatibility on UNIX platforms which don't support
       some of the facilities used by .gsh who/last. 
       Compile GAEN sources with "make nosupport" for this
     * more 'spatiality' provided by .stereo command
     * more hints (total of 130)
     * minor fixes of .lusers command to correctly generate the XML files
     * minor changes of .rename command
     * other minor modifications of internal code

                             Compiling advices
                                      
   To understand some things, you must have some familiarity with NUTS
   and you must read first the NUTS original documentation files (not
   included in this distribution). Then, read the documentation files
   included within GAEN Distribution package. To compile the sources, you
   may use easy.compile, a fast and portable shell (sh) script file
   written by Victor Tarhon-Onu.
                                      
   If you prefer a direct method, type cc gaen.c -ogaend -O2 (for RedHat
   5 or later, you must compile with -lcrypt optional parameter; for Sun
   Solaris, -lsocket -lnsl, also), then use go (or gaend) to boot up the
   server.
                                      
   Then, you must create an administration account: type gaen -b Name.
   After this, to connect to talker server, you may use telnet localhost
   7000, type Name as a name and Name as a password. Enjoy!
