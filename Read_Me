                                            Sources
     _____________________________________________________________________________________

   GAEN is freeware. You may modify the code to suit your needs, but you must NOT alter the
   credits.

   GAEN Distribution is freely available in the following distribution: the GAEN M (18.2)
   version (August 1996 - May 2002). This version is available in .tar.gz format (unpack with
   gunzip and tar -xf commands at the UNIX shell prompt):
     * gaen_M_18_2.tar.gz talker files (sources, config, data, help, additional files) -
       about 350K (see http://www.infoiasi.ro/~busaco/gaen/)

                                       Compiling advices

   To understand some things, you must have some familiarity with NUTS and you must read
   first the NUTS original documentation files (not included in this distribution). Then,
   read the documentation files included within GAEN Distribution package. To compile the
   sources, you may use easy.compile, a fast and portable shell (sh) script file written by
   Victor Tarhon-Onu.

   If you prefer a direct method, type cc gaen.c -ogaend -O2 (for RedHat 5 or later, you must
   compile with -lcrypt optional parameter; for Sun Solaris, -lsocket -lnsl, also), then use
   go (or gaend) to boot up the server. We provide a simple Makefile, too.

   Then, you must create an administration account: type gaen -b Name. After this, to connect
   to talker server, you may use telnet localhost 7000, type Name as a name and Name as a
   password. Enjoy!
