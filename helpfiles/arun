* arun *

Syntax: arun in/out/normal/swap/<digit> [ <command> ]

	Add a command to file executed at login/logout/swap time or explicitly 
by user ('normal' parameter). If you use <digit> you can add command to a 
file who will be executed by .for or .if or .event commands.

	If <command> is missing, then you can view the list of commands.
	If the added command begins with # then it will be ignored 
	(means comment in run commands file).
