* clearline *

Usage: clearline [<line number>]

This allows you to clear a line that is hung though this can only be
done for users who are attempting to login. Since the server automatically
times out logins this command is for convenience only if you need to clear
a line quickly. Without any parameter, this command will clear all wrong
lines (invalid sockets).
