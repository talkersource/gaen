~FG--->>> Colours commands <<<---

All the commands start with a ~ and are the following:

RS - reset terminal to default colour status
RV - reverse video
OL - bold
LI - blink/flash text (only the text flashes, not the background colour). 
     This won't work on all terminals, some xterms simply set it to bold.
UL - underline text, this doesn't work on all terminals.

FK - set foreground colour to black
FR - foreground red
FG - green
FY - yellow (though it looks an orangey brown on some systems)
FB - blue
FM - magenta/purple
FT - turquoise/bright blue
FW - white

BK - set background colour to black
BR - red
BG - green
BY - yellow
BB - blue
BM - magenta
BT - turqouise
BW - white

You can print out colour commands as themselves by prepending them with a
forward slash '/'.
