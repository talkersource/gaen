* csay *

Usage: csay <sky>

Will make one of your clones in the given sky speak. If you see something
nasty being said in the clones sky its an alternative to shouting, telling
or actually going to the sky to admonish the miscreant. The short-cut for
this command is the ' sign.

See: .clone, .destroy, .allclones, .myclones, .chear, .switch
