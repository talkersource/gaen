* delete *

Usage: delete <user>

This will delete a user on the system but they cannot be logged in at the time
so if someone is annoying you .kill them first *then* delete them. Using this
command can make you seriously unpopular so you'd better get your facts right
about someone before you delete them... :) Of course, later you can give
birth again... :)
