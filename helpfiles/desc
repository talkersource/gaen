* desc *

Usage: desc [<description>]

This sets the message your description, ie that which follows your name
when other people view the sky or use the "who" command etc. If you omit the
description it displays your current one.
Your description can contain a special pseudo-variable ~OL{name}~RS which
will be replaced by the user's name who will see your description at .look,
.status etc. commands.

Example: ~FT.desc loves {name}

See: .outphr, .inphr
