* entpro *

Syntax: entpro [ <text> ]

This command allows you to enter a lengthy description (profile) or yourself
that people will see when they use the examine command. Since you can write
anything you like here people tend to use it for all sorts of things. You
can add to your profile a line if you use this command with parameters.

In your profile, you can use two pseudo-variables to replace the name and
the level of the user who examine you;

~OL{name}~RS	 	will be replaced by the username who .examine you
~OL{level}~RS 	will be replaced by the user level who .examine you

Examples:
~FTHello, {name} ! I'm glad to talk! Your level is {level}, good!

See: .examine, .set
