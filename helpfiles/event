* event *

Syntax: 
  event none/?
  event in/out/shout/bhole/bcast/kill/mirror/afk/noafk/swear/swap [<text>]

	This command permits you to define an action which will be executed at
the time when the login/logout event or the shout/bhole/bcast/kill/mirror 
commands occured or are used by someone. To view all definitions type .event ?. 
To erase all definitions use .event none. 
To define an event you must use the second form of this command.

	The third form is available only for superior users:

event send [in/out/shout/bhole/bcast/kill/mirror/afk/noafk/swear/swap [<val>]] 

	When an event occured, a special variable called * is set to user
name which sent an event, or to <val> when it is present.

~FGExamples:
	.event in .tell * How are you today?
	.event afk .think He, he, you're OK?...
