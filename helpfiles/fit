* fit *

Syntax: fit <person> [ <another_person> ]

	Use this command to view the fitting (compatibility) score between
two persons. GAEN Fit uses an ancient and sophisticated method for this
purpose... Are you believe this? :)
	If you omit the second parameter, the score will be calculated for
you and the given <person>.
