Syntax:  .for <digit> <option>/<list_of_words>
	 .for <option> : <command>
	 .for help/?


	The purpose of the command is to iterate the execution of a run
commands file (see the first form) or the execution of a command (see the
second form). 
	To view the available options use .for ? or .for help.

Details:
	.for <digit> users

commands included in the run commands file.
