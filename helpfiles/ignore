	This command has multiple purposes:

	You can manage the list of your ignored users. The command's forms
	are the following:

	.ignore add/+ <user>

	Adds an user to your ignored users private list.

	.ignore del/- <user>

	Deletes an ignored user from your list.

	.ignore list/?

	List all ignored users.

	If an user is ignored, he/she can obtain forgiveness with:
	 
	.ignore forgive/# <user>

	You can use the command without parameters (this form replaces the
	old .ignall command):

	.ignore

	This is a toggle that lets you listen or not to the conversation in the
	sky and any shouts and tells. Basically you ignore everything. This is 
	usefull if you want to read your mail or the message boards and you 
	don't want any speech appearing between pages.
