* minlogin *

Usage: minlogin NONE/<user level> [ keep ]

This sets the minimum login level of a user that can log in. This directly
affects the main port but only affects the saint port if it is set higher than
the saint_port login level. If set to NONE then anyone can log in and new users
can be created, if set to GUEST no new accounts can be created but users of
level GUEST can still log in. If set to SOUL then only users of level SOUL and
above can log in and so on...

Use 'keep' option if you want to keep users of level below minlogin level.
