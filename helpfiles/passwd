* passwd *

Syntax: .passwd <old password> <new password> [ <user> ]

	This command allows you to change your password. But be careful to
remember it. The new password must be secure (some tests are done to ensure
this). If you haven't found a secure password, try again.
	Superior level users can change the other user's password 
        (only a full username is allowed).

Note:	Try using combinations of letters, numbers and special characters
	like as !"$%^&*()#~
