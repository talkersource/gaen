	For being promoted, all users must have the details real and completed
	(~FT.set~RS, ~FT.desc~RS and ~FT.entpro~RS). The time limits can be 
	ignored in special situations. They only express some periods of time 
	in which the constant behavior of an user can say something about
	his/her character.
	The promotions are not given by request, but depending on each user's
	behavior and the degree of acquaintance.

   ~OL~FRBeware:

        ~LI~OL~FRDO NOT ASK FOR PROMOTIONS AND DO NOT DISCUSS OTHER USERS' RANKS
