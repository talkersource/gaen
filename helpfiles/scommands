Syntax: scommands list/reload/erase/<command> <level>

	This powerful command allows you to change the level of
accessibility for certain commands. Each command is available to be used by
users of a certain level or higher. 
	Use .scommands <command> <level> to change this level. You can use:

	.scommands <command> none

	to make the command invisible (unavailable) for all users.

	Your changes will be saved to a special file. To reload it, use
'reload' parameter and to list all changed access levels and commands, try
'list' or just '?'. You can erase the commands file using 'erase' parameter.
	The commands levels file is automatically loaded at the boot time.
