* swears *

Syntax:	swears <option>

The command is an extension of old .swban command and implements new
operations with swear words file.

The options are:

	list		show the swear words list 
			You can use '?' instead of 'list'.

	add <word>	add a new word to file 
			(the internal list will be updated,
			use _ as space if you need spaces in word;
			eg. '.swears add help_me' to ban 'help me')
			You can use '+' instead of 'add'.

	zap		remove the swear words file
			(the internal list isn't wiped)

	on		set swearing ban flag to ~FGON

	off		set swearing ban flag to ~FROFF

	erase <word>	erase a word from swears file
			You can use '-' instead of 'erase'. 

	reload		reload the swears file

The swears file is loaded at the boot time of the talker.

~OL~FRWhen an user is swearing, she or he will be punished, of course! :)
