* terminal *

Syntax: terminal [ charecho/blind/lines/wrap ]

	.terminal charecho

	This form replaces the old command .charecho. This is a command that 
is only of use to people who use character mode clients. Some of these clients 
won't echo the characters input themselves even when told to do so so this 
command forces the talker to do it instead. The command is a toggle so using 
it will alternately flick the echoing on and off. If you switch echoing on 
even when your client is echoing you will see every character twice.

	.terminal blind

	This form disables writing of all messages sent to you by others or
by talker. To exit from this mode you must enter .terminal without
parameters. This option is available only for ANGEL or higher levels.

	.terminal lines [<number>]

	This option set the number of paged lines (default is 23).
	
	.terminal wrap
	
	This form is a toggle so using it will alternately flick the wrapping
lines on and off. Use this option for dumb terminal clients.

	Use .terminal without parameters to disable blind mode.
