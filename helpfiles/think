Syntax: .think [<parameter>] [<text>]

think about nothing. The shortcut for .think is / sign.

	When you use the optional <parameter>s:

	- parameter - your thoughts will be printed backwards,
	= parameter - your thoughts will be printed mixed,
	| parameter - your thoughts will be printed in mixed case,
        \ parameter - your thoughts will be printed randomly.
