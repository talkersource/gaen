<h3>Original concepts and development</h3>

<li><b> GSL (GAEN Simple Language)</b>
	<ul>
        GAEN includes a high-level scripting programming language which
offer run commands files executed by the logged on users, user private 
variables, test (<tt>.if</tt>) and cycle (<tt>.for</tt>) statements. 
Using the flexible  
<tt>.if</tt> command we can test the presence of an user, some status flags of an
user or talker's flags etc. It's possible to iterate the execution of a 
command using <tt>.for</tt> and <tt>.execute</tt> commands.
</ul>
<li><b> gsh (GAEN SHell)</b>
	<ul>
        A minimal set of UNIX operating system commands is available: <tt>ls,
more, tail, grep, mkdir, cd, chmod, who, last, cp, mv</tt> etc.</ul>
</ul>
<li> <b>events</b>
	<ul>
        Some actions of the users generate an event: log-in, log-out, shout,
broadcast of an important message and so on. For each event, the users are  
able to associate a command to be executed when that event will occur.
</ul>
<li><b>user's environment</b>
<ul>
        The possibility to save/restore some user information flags (such as
ignoring all tells flag, ignoring sending of pictures, the tone of the voice
etc.) in a special file.
</ul>
<li><b>internal hosts file</b>
<ul>
        To avoid the waiting of response from name servers to obtain host
name of a connected user, we have the facility to consult an internal file
with IPs and host names (in the present, the hosts file counts more than 300
entries).
</ul>
