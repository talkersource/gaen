"The majority of the diseases which the human family have been and still are
suffering under, they have created by ignorance of their own organic health,
and work perseveringly to tear themselves to pieces, and when broken down
and debilitated in body and mind, send for the doctor and drug themselves to
death." (Ellen White)
