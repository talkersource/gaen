"Perfect love is rare indeed... To be a lover will require that you
 continually have the subtlety of the very wise, the flexibility of
 the child, the sensitivity of the artist, the understanding of the
 philosopher, the acceptance of the saint, the tolerance of the
 scholar, and the fortitude of the certain." (Leo Buscaglia)
