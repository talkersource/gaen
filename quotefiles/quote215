"Are we to look at cherry blossoms only in full bloom, the moon only when it 
is cloudless? To long for the moon while looking on the rain, to lower the 
blinds and be unaware of the passing of the spring -- these are even more 
deeply moving. Branches about to blossom or gardens strewn with flowers are 
worthier of our admiration." (Yoshida Kenko)
