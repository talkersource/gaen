    "Born on Monday,
     Fair in face;
     Born on Tuesday,
     Full of God's grace;
     Born on Wednesday,
     Sour and sad;
     Born on Thursday,
     Merry and glad;
     Born on Friday,
     Worthily given;
     Born on Saturday,
     Work hard for your living;
     Born on Sunday,
     You will never know want."   (Anonymous)
