"Life is huge! Rejoice about the sun, moon, flowers, and sky.
 Rejoice about the food you have to eat. Rejoice about the body that houses 
 your spirit. Rejoice about the fact that you can be a positive force in the 
 world around you. Rejoice about the love that is around you. If you want to 
 be happy, commit to making your life one of rejoicing."
