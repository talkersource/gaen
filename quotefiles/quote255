"Father Time is not always a hard parent, and, though he tarries for none of 
his children, often lays his hand lightly upon those who have used him well; 
making them old men and women inexorably enough, but leaving their hearts and 
spirits young and in full vigour. With such people the grey head is but the 
impression of the old fellow's hand in giving them his blessing, and every
wrinkle but a notch in the quiet calendar of a well-spent life."
(Charles Dickens)
