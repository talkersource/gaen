"So different are the colours of life, as we look forward to the future, 
 or backward to the past; and so different the opinions and sentiments which 
 this contrariety of appearance naturally produces, that the conversation of 
 the old and young ends generally with contempt or pity on either side."
 (Samuel Johnson)
