"To fear death, my friends, is only to think ourselves wise, without being 
wise: for it is to think that we know what we do not know. For anything that 
men can tell, death may be the greatest good that can happen to them: but they 
fear it as if they knew quite well that it was the greatest of evils. And 
what is this but that shameful ignorance of thinking that we know what we 
do not know?" (Socrates)
