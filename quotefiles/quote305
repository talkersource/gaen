"Dream is not a revelation. If a dream affords the dreamer some light on 
himself, it is not the person with closed eyes who makes the discovery but the 
person with open eyes lucid enough to fit thoughts together. 
Dream - a scintillating mirage surrounded by shadows - is essentially poetry."
(Michel Leiris)
