When Christ said: "I was hungry and you fed me," he didn't mean only the
hunger for bread and for food; he also meant the hunger to be loved. Jesus
himself experienced this loneliness. He came amongst his own and his own
received him not, and it hurt him then and it has kept on hurting him. The
same hunger, the same loneliness, the same having no one to be accepted by
and to be loved and wanted by. Every human being in that case resembles
Christ in his loneliness; and that is the hardest part, that's real hunger."
(Mother Teresa)
