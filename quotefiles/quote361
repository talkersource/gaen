"A man can be a hero if he is a scientist, or a soldier, or a drug addict,
or a disc jockey, or a crummy mediocre politician. A man can be a hero
because he suffers and despairs; or because he thinks logically and
analytically; or because he is 'sensitive'; or because he is cruel. Wealth
establishes a man as a hero, and so does poverty. Virtually any
circumstance in a man's life will make him a hero to some group of people
and has a mythic rendering in the culture -  in literature, art, theater, or
the daily newspapers." (Andrea Dworkin)
