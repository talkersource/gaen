"Your life is an island separated from all other islands and continents.
Regardless of how many botas you send to other shores or how many ships
arrive uponm your shores, you yourself are an island separated by its own
pains, secluded in its happiness and far away in its compassion and hidden
in its secrets and mysteries." (Kahlil Gibran)
