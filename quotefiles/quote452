"You need an infinite stretch of time ahead of you to start to think,
infinite energy to make the smallest decision. The world is getting
denser. The immense number of useless projects is bewildering. Too many
things have to be put in to balance up an uncertain scale. You can't
disappear anymore. You die in a state of total indecision."
(Jean Baudrillard)
