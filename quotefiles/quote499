"After all, the world is not a stage - not to me: nor a theatre: nor a
show-house of any sort. And art, especially novels, are not little
theatres where the reader sits aloft and watches ... and sighs,
commiserates, condones and smiles.  That's what you want a book to be:
because it leaves you so safe and superior, with your two-dollar ticket to
the show. And that's what my books are not and never will be ... Whoever
reads me will be in the thick of the scrimmage, and if he doesn't like it,
if he wants a safe seat in the audience - let him read someone else."
(D. H. Lawrence)
