Fifteen hundred years ago, everybody knew that the Earth was
                                                   the center of the Universe.
Five hundred years ago, everybody knew that the Earth was flat.
Fifteen minutes ago, you knew that humans were alone on this planet.
Just THINK what you'll know tomorrow.     (M.I.B.)
