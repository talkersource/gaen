"Bear in mind that the children of life are the children of joy; that the
lower animals are only unhappy when made so by man; that man alone of
all the creatures, has "found out many inventions", the chief of which
appears to be the art of makind himself miserable, and of seeing all Nature
stained with that dark and hateful colour." (W.H.Hudson)
