"An act of violence against nature should be judged as severely as that
against society or another person. The turning over of a stone, the
unnecessary felling of a tree, or the slaughter of an animal is a crime to be
weighed in judgement against the wants and needs of the person and the values 
of his society." (Dr.Michael W.Fox)
