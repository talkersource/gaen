"What is it you all are doing pretending to be real?  Are you trying
to make me believe that I am unreal, standing strangely on the green
pavement? Yet it's been so long since you were real, you Sky, and you 
Ring Square have never been real.  It is true, you are all still 
superior to me, but only when I leave you in peace." (F.KAFKA)
