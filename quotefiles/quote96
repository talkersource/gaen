"One may say that evil does not exist for subjective man at all, that there
exist only different conceptions of good. Nobody ever does anything
deliberately in the interests of evil, for the sake of evil. Everybody acts in
the interests of good, as he understands it. But everybody understands it in a
different way. Consequently men drown, slay, and kill one another in the
interests of good." (Gurdjieff)
