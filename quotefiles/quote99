"Misdirected life force is the activity in disease process.
 Disease has no energy save what it borrows from the life of the organism.
 It is by adjusting the life force that healing must be brought about, and
 it is the sun as transformer and distributor of primal spiritual energy 
 that must be utilized in this process, for life and the sun are so intimately 
 connected." (KABBALAH)
